### Neural Nets
The start of DL is with neural nets the basic building blocks of an ANN<br>
Then comes the bigger one's CNN, RNN, LSTM, GRU, Encoders
### Pytorch linear Regression
The linear regression is done with the help of neural network by updating by loss<br>
Hence, we need an optimizer which helps to obtain the lower minimum easily<br>
Adding self tested models on a single dataset, as well as with the standard ones<br>
Within this week updated<br>
<ol>
<li>Added the ANN or Artificial Neural Network layer with just simple dense layer</li>
<li> It is the simple neural net layer which can be said to be building block of bigger layer</li>
<li> Just adjust the weights differently and with certain layers and you can modify the behaviour</li>
</ol>
### Convolution Neural Nets (Uses convolution function on matrices)
The convolution function in Calculus help to identify the necessary <br>
Information into the noised data  in order to approximate a pattern.<br>
Thus in 2D data it helps(Actually 4D or 5D to be accurate in  models) to<br>
formulate the specific pattern in the network.<br>
