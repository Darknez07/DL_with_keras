### Neural Nets
The start of DL is with neural nets the basic building blocks of an ANN<br>
Then comes the bigger one's CNN, RNN, LSTM, GRU, Encoders
### Pytorch linear Regression
The linear regression is done with the help of neural network by updating by loss<br>
Hence, we need an optimizer which helps to obtain the lower minimum easily<br>
Adding self tested models on a single dataset, as well as with the standard ones<br>
Within this week updated<br>
